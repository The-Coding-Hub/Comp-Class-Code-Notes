Introduction to CSS :-

-> It stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.
-> We can add the style sheet in three different ways:
   i) External
   ii) Internal
   iii) Inline

External CSS :-
-> It is used when we want to make changes on multiple pages.
-> It uses the <link> tag on every page and the <link> tag should be put inside the head section.

HTML Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Introduction to CSS</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css1.css">
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
</body>
</html>

CSS Code (File Name: css1.css):
body {
	background-color: purple;
}

h1 {
	color: white;
	text-align: center;
}

Internal CSS :-
-> It is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
-> It uses <style> tag within the head element.

HTML Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Internal CSS</title>

	<style type="text/css">
		body {
			background-color: pink;
		}
		h1 {
			color: white;
			text-align: center;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to Internal CSS</h1>
</body>
</html>

Inline CSS:
-> It is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML tag or element.
-> It uses style attribute.

HTML Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline CSS</title>
</head>
<body style="background-color: pink;">
	<h1 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Welcome to Inline CSS</h1>
</body>
</html>

CSS Syntax:
h1 { color: red; text-align: center; }

Property: color & text-align
Value: red & center
The part inside curly braces is called DECLARATION BOX.

The selector indicates the HTML element. It could be any tag like body, h1, p or span.

Property:
The property is a type of attribute of a HTML element.

Value: Values are assigned to CSS Properties.

CSS Selectors:
CSS Selectors are used to select the content we want to style.
Types: 
1) CSS Element Selector: The element selector selects the HTML element by name.

2) CSS ID Selector: It selects the ID attribute of an HTML element to select a particle element. An ID is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element. It is written with the Hash Character (#), followed by the ID of an element.

3) CSS Class Selector: The Class Selector selects HTML elements with a specific class. It is used with a period character (.) followed by the Class Name. A Class Name should not be started with a number i.e. 1para.

4) CSS Universal Selector

5) CSS Group Selector

CSS Colors:
1) Built-In Color
2) RGB Format
3) RGBA Format
4) Hexadecimal Code
5) HSL
6) HSLA

Built-In Color:
-> As it's name implies, built in color means the collection of previously defined colors that are used by using a name such as Red, Green, Tomato etc.
-> Ex:- style=background-color: tomato;

RGB Format:
-> It stands for "RED GREEN BLUE".
R - 0 to 255
G - 0 to 255
B - 0 to 255
-> The color values in this format are specified by using the rgb() function. This function allows three values that can be either be in percentage or integer (0 - 255).

RGBA Format:
-> It is similar to RGB format except that RGBA contains A(Alpha Value - Opacity/Transparency)
-> Alpha Value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0
0.0 - Transparent
1.0 - Opaque

HSL:
-> It stands for "Hue Saturation Lightness".
-> Hue: It can be defined as the degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 represents RED, 120 represents GREEN, 240 represents BLUE.
-> Saturation: It takes value in percentage in which 100% represents fully saturated (No Gray Shade!, 50% represents 50% Grey, but the color is still visible and 0% represents fully unsaturated means completely grey and the color is invisible.)
-> Lightness: It can be defined as the light that we want to provide the color. Here 0% means black (There is no light!), 50% represents neither dark nor light and 100% represents white (Full Lightness).
-> By default Saturation and Lightness are 0%.


CSS Borders:
-> The border property is used to set the border on an element.
-> It specifies style, color and size.
-> border-style: It is used to specify the border type. 
-> border-color: We can specify the border color in three ways. i.e Color Name, RGB Name and Hexadecimal Name
-> border-width: It is used to set the border's width. It is set in pixels. It has three predefined values called 'thin', 'thick' and 'medium'.
-> border-radius: It sets the rounded border and sets the rounded corners around and element tags. It defines the radius of the corners of the borders.
-> There are four properties:
	i) border-top-left-radius: Border Radius for Top Left Corner
	ii) border-top-right-radius: Border Radius for Top Right Corner
	iii) border-bottom-left-radius: Border Radius for Bottom Left Corner
	iv) border-bottom-right-radius: Border Radius for Bottom Right Corner

	Ex:
	i) border-radius: 20px;
	Sets border radius as 20px for all corners.
	ii) border-radius: 20% 10%;
	Sets 20% for Top Left and Bottom Right Corner and Sets 10% Top Right and Bottom Left Corner.
	iii) border-radius: 10% 20% 30%;
	Sets 10% for Top Left Corner, 20% for Top Right and Bottom Left Corner and 30% for Bottom Right Corner.
	iv) border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 40%;
	Sets 10% for Top Left Corner, 20% for Top Right Corner, 30% for Bottom Right Corner and 40% Bottom Left Corner.
-> Percentage: It denotes the size of the radius in percentage. It doesn't allow negative value.
