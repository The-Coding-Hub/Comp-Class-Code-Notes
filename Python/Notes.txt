- A variable in programming is used to store data (values). 
- A variable name consists of Alphabets (A - Z), Numbers (0 - 9) and Underscore (_).
Ex: x = 10

Python Datatypes:
1. String: String is a textual data surrounded by quotes ("" or '').
2. Integer: Numeric Data.
3. Float: Numeric Data.

Python Literal or Constant:
Literal is raw data used for representing fixed value.
Ex: x = 25.23
Here x - Variable, 25.23 - Literal

Numeric Literal:
Integer: Integers like: 2, 4
Float: Decimals like 1.2, 3.4
Complex Number: 1.5j, 2+3.5j

The complex() function converts the real numbers to complex numbers.
The real part can be accessed by using the function real() and imaginary part can be accessed by using the function imag()

String Literals
- It is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.
