Introduction to PYTHON Programming:

Step 1 - Installing Python
https://www.python.org/download/

Step 2 - Install IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment)
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Another Way:
Install Anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/

Variable:
- A variable in programming is used to store data (values). 
- A variable name consists of Alphabets (A - Z), Numbers (0 - 9) and Underscore (_).
Ex: x = 10
Here x is a Variable.
- We can use underscore if we want to create a variables which consists of more than 2 words. 
Ex: user_name = "Harry"

Python Datatypes:
1. String: String is a textual data surrounded by quotes ("" or '').
2. Integer: Numeric Data.
3. Float: Numeric Data.

Python Literal or Constant:
Literal is raw data used for representing fixed value.
Ex: x = 25.23
Here x - Variable, 25.23 - Literal

Numeric Literal:
Integer: Integers like: 2, 4
Float: Decimals like 1.2, 3.4
Complex Number: 1.5j, 2+3.5j

The complex() function converts the real numbers to complex numbers.
The real part can be accessed by using the function real() and imaginary part can be accessed by using the function imag()

String Literals
- It is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.
- We can use single quotes, double quotes and triple quotes.
- For Multiline Strings we use triple quotes(''' ''' or """ """).
- a = "Hello"
- b = 'World'
- c = """
      I
      am a 
      Disco 
      Dancer
      """

Boolean Literals
- There are two boolean literals True and False.
- It is important to note that True and False are case sensitive.
- Ex: p = True

Comment in Python
- The Python Interpreter ignores these lines.
- The Hash(#) symbol is used to write a comment in Python.
- Ex: a = 10 # 10 is stored in the variable 'a'
- To add a Multiline Line Comment we can use a # for each line.
- Ex: # I am a Disco Dancer
      # Zindegi mera gaana, Mein Kisika Deewana
- We can also use 3 triple quotes.
Ex: ''' I am a Disco Dancer
        Zindegi mera gaana, Mein Kisika Deewana '''

PYTHON Input and Output
- Python provides built-in functions that allows us to Output data and take input from user.
- input() -> Input
- print() -> Output
- Ex:
print("My Name is Khan")
a = 5
b = 6
c = a + b
print("The sum of a and b is", c)
- To print more than one object at a time we separate them by commas.
- Ex: print("My ", "name ", "is ", "DD ")

Taking Input from the User
- To take input from the user and store it in a variable, we use input() function.
