Introduction to PYTHON Programming:

Step 1 - Installing Python
https://www.python.org/download/

Step 2 - Install IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment)
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Another Way:
Install Anaconda

Variable:
- A variable in programming is used to store data (values). 
- A variable name consists of Alphabets (A - Z), Numbers (0 - 9) and Underscore (_).
Ex: x = 10
Here x is a Variable.
- We can use underscore if we want to create a variables which consists of more than 2 words. 
Ex: user_name = "Harry"

Python Datatypes:
1. String: String is a textual data surrounded by quotes ("" or '').
2. Integer: Numeric Data.
3. Float: Numeric Data.

Python Literal or Constant:
Literal is raw data used for representing fixed value.
Ex: x = 25.23
Here x - Variable, 25.23 - Literal

Numeric Literal:
Integer: Integers like: 2, 4
Float: Decimals like 1.2, 3.4
Complex Number: 1.5j, 2+3.5j

The complex() function converts the real numbers to complex numbers.
The real part can be accessed by using the function real() and imaginary part can be accessed by using the function imag()

String Literals
- It is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.
- We can use single quotes, double quotes and triple quotes.
- For Multiline Strings we use triple quotes(''' ''' or """ """).
- a = "Hello"
- b = 'World'
- c = """
      I
      am a 
      Disco 
      Dancer
      """

Boolean Literals
- There are two boolean literals True and False.
- It is important to note that True and False are case sensitive.
- Ex: p = True

Comment in Python
- The Python Interpreter ignores these lines.
- The Hash(#) symbol is used to write a comment in Python.
- Ex: a = 10 # 10 is stored in the variable 'a'
- To add a Multiline Line Comment we can use a # for each line.
- Ex: # I am a Disco Dancer
      # Zindegi mera gaana, Mein Kisika Deewana
- We can also use 3 triple quotes.
Ex: ''' I am a Disco Dancer
        Zindegi mera gaana, Mein Kisika Deewana '''

PYTHON Input and Output
- Python provides built-in functions that allows us to Output data and take input from user.
- input() -> Input
- print() -> Output
- Ex:
print("My Name is Khan")
a = 5
b = 6
c = a + b
print("The sum of a and b is", c)
- To print more than one object at a time we separate them by commas.
- Ex: print("My ", "name ", "is ", "DD ")

Taking Input from the User
- To take input from the user and store it in a variable, we use input() function.

Typecasting in Python
- The Process of converting one data type to another data type is called Type Casting.
- 2 Types:
  - Implicit Type Conversion
  - Explicit Type Conversion
- Implicit Conversion
  - In Implicit Conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. 
  - In this process no data is lost.
  - Ex:
  x = 100
  y = 2.3
  print(x + y) # Output: 102.3
  - Here Python automatically converts 100 to Float (100.0) before addition. The Data Type os sum will also be Float. (100.0 + 2.3 = 102.3)
- Explicit Conversion
  - This conversion is done by the programmer.
  - In this process data might be lost.
  - Ex: On converting a float to integer the decimal part is lost.
  - In this conversion, we can use predefined functions like int(), float() and str() etc. to convert one datatype to another datatype.
  - Ex: 
  # Example 1
  p = 125.3
  q = int(a)
  print(b) # Output: 125 ( Float -> Integer )
  # Example 2
  c = 123
  d = float(c)
  print(d) # Output: 123.0 ( Integer -> Float )
  - Ex:
  country_name = 'INDIA'
  x = int(country_name)
  Here Python can not convert "INDIA" to Integer, we will get an "Value" Error.
  - Ex:
  num = "125"
  num2 = int(num)
  num3 = float(num)
  print(num2) # Output: 125
  print(num3) # Output: 125.0

Operators in Python
- An Operatoris a special symbol that carries out arithmetic or login computation.
1) Arithmetic Operator:
  - These are the operators used for performing arithmetic operations.
  - (+) Operator: 
    - The + Operator is used to add 2 operands (data).
    - The + Operator is also used to Concatenate 2 Strings.
    - Ex:
    x = 'Satwik'
    y = 'Patnaik'
    name = x + ' ' + y
    print(name) # OP - Satwik Patnaik
  - (-) Operator:
    - It is used to subtract the right operand from the left.
    - Ex:
    x = 10
    y = 5
    sub = x - y
    print(sub) # OP - 5
  - (*) Operator:
    - It is used to multiply 2 operands.
    - Ex:
    x = 10
    y = 5
    pro = x*y
    print(pro) # OP - 50
    - It is also used to repeat Strings.
    - Ex:
    x = 15
    y = 3
    pro = x*y
    print(pro) # OP - 45
    - Ex:
    x = 'Satwik'
    y = x*'3'
    print(y) # OP - TypeError
  - (/) Operator:
    - The (/) Operator is used to divide left operand by the right one.
    - Ex:
    x = 15/3
    print(x) # OP - 5
    - The (//)->Integer Devision Operator is used to get only the Integer Part of the Answer.
    - Ex:
    x = 13
    y = 3
    print(x//y) # OP - 4
  - (%) Operator:
    - The Modulus Operator (%) gives remainder of Division.
    - Ex:
    x = 13 % 5
    print(x)
  - (**) Operator:
    - The Exponent Operator (**) raises the left operand to the power of the right.
    - Ex:
    x = 2**4
    print(x) # OP - 16

Conditionals in Python

- if Statement
  - The if Statement evaluates evaluates the Boolean expression.
  - If the Boolean expression is True, then the if Statement is executed!
  - Syntax:
    if boolean_expresssion:
      statement 1
      statement 2

- if ... else Statement
  - The if ... else statement provides an else block combined with the if statement which is executed in the false case of the condition.
  - Syntax:
    if boolean_expresssion:
      statement(s)
    else:
      statement(s)

- if ... elif ... else Statement
  - It allows us to make a choice from more than two options, we can use the elif part in the if ... eles statement.
  - Syntax:
    if boolean_expresssion:
      statement(s)
    elif:
      statement(s)
    else:
      statement(s)

NB: There can be 0 or more elif parts. By the way, elif is the short form for else if.

Loop in Python
- While Loop in Python
  - In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as the Boolean Expression is True.
  - It is an entry controlled loop.
  - Syntax
  while Bool:
    code
    increment/decrement
  - Infinite While Loop
  In this case the body of the while loop is executed endlessly. A loop that never terminates is called an Infinite Loop.

While Loop with Else:
- In Python a while loop can have an optional else block.
- The else part is executed after the condition in the while loop evaluates to false
